## Introduction

"Me the Project" is an oppurtunity to take time to explore areas, topics, technical or
non-technical to be proactive in strengthening my weak areas to move forward in the
remainder of the Epicodus program with more confidence as we begin our job search.

## Game Plan 
After some reflection I have narrowed down some areas that I would like to spend my time
on that will provide me with the above mentioned confidence moving forward.

* Past Experience Review Technical and Non-Technical
* Client Side -v- Server Side Big Picture Review
* HackReactor, Hackerrank
* typing.io 

### Past Experience Review

#### What is holding me back? 

#### Technical
I have significant Engineering Experience that I have been very excited to return to
with my new Epicodus Software Skills. What is holding me back? After an 8 year gap of
staying home to raise my children I am struggling to speak with ease about my
past experiences to accurately reflect my skillset. Frankly it's embarrassing. I dedicated
close to 20 years to my education and career, and after years of 3 children, life events,
and twists and turns, the details of my experience allude me, chipping away at my confidence,
and leaving me with fear of assembling a resume and interviewing. It is important to me to 
represent my past in a way that feels good, so as a self-assigned topic, I'd like to take 
the time today to review key concepts of my past experience as a refresher, and a step to the future.

##### Document

#### Non-Technical
When I started my engineering career in the 90's there was not the attention and support there
is today regarding Women in Engineering. I feel proud to witness the change of times, but it
is not without the awarenes how I have been shaped by past experiences and am left feeling anxious
of what to expect returning to the workplace. Historically, I have shoved aside experiences that 
I felt inappropriate because I loved my job and found it emotionally confusing how to navigate
such incidents. Moving forward, I aspire to find my voice with such issues with the guidance of 
a mentor, and help advocate for other women who find themselves questioning behaviors in their 
work environment.
